1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420
With all this in mind, deciding where to begin is quite a conundrum.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,920
Not least because S actually begins before the beginning, on the inside cover page of

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,920
Ship of Theseus.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,560
How we're going to structure this essay is go layer by layer.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,460
There are three different narratives in this book, all of which intertwine.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,340
The first is the handwritten notes, which are set in the present day of 2012.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,160
The second layer is the mystery of VMStraka that the annotators are trying to solve, including

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,640
all the historical events and people they learn about, which are fictional to us but

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,520
real within the world of S, i.e. the book as a whole.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,200
This historical narrative mostly takes place from the 1910s to the 1950s.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,080
Then the last layer is the Ship of Theseus novel itself, supposedly published in 1949.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,960
This is its own narrative, but also links to the historical layer, so it makes sense

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,960
to discuss last.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,600
Layer one is technically the most straightforward, but all these notes are non-chronological.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,680
Part of the fun of this book is deciding how to even tackle reading it, but this does mean

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,120
some readers will struggle to follow everything.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,920
So, in this first part, we wanted to re-chronologise this outermost narrative and explain everything

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,000
that happens to our two narrators in order.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,800
We will only discuss the Straka mystery elements when it's necessary to understand for context,

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,780
because otherwise all the names and dates will get lost very quickly.

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,160
We will try to emphasise which details are most important to remember, but just to warn

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,440
you, this is a lot of information to cover even within this layer.

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,320
Until we can really dive into analysis later, buckle in.

24
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,160
First though, let's cover from the first page up to the end of the foreword, because

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,880
this sets up the main Straka mystery and our important present-day characters.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,120
An undergrad literature student finds Ship of Theseus while shelving the library of Pollard

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,800
State University.

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,080
It says to return to workroom B19, which is assigned to a Mr. Thomas Chadwick and seemingly

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,880
has a few of his notes written in the margins.

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,040
She's curious enough to read the book, loves it, and writes the owner a message.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,280
He's at first annoyed that she would write on his book, in pen no less, but then she

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,240
starts sharing her thoughts.

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,960
The two begin passing the book between them, making notes in the margins and leaving it

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,660
on a specific shelf for the other to find.

35
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,800
We quickly learn that the undergrad is called Jen and is in her final semester.

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,520
She also works as an assistant in the main library, hence the shelving.

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,080
The other writer is a bit guarded at first.

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,400
He says he's been studying Straka for 12 years, since high school, and is seven years

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,680
into a PhD, but claims he'll never get it because of his former supervisor, one professor,

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
Moody.

41
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,840
Writer number two calls Moody a liar and a thief, and says he is racing the clock before

42
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,320
the latter cashes in on his work.

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,400
We don't know what this means yet, but Moody is apparently close to publishing something,

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,640
because he recently signed into the library archive with some big New York editor.

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Now, it doesn't take long for Jen to work out that this person she's writing to is

46
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,100
not Mr Chadwick, but when she stops writing, he drops all pretense immediately and introduces

47
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,040
himself as Eric.

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,760
Eric shows her an article from the local newspaper to explain.

49
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,360
Turns out, last Christmas he blew up at Moody during a holiday party, then flooded one of

50
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,920
the college buildings.

51
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,520
Moody got him expunged, and he ended up spending two months in a psychiatric hospital.

52
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,720
So Eric is in a bad place.

53
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
He claims that no other Straka researchers will touch him now, except for one guy in

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
Paris.

55
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,560
So with our two present-day main characters here, what do we know about this VMS mystery?

56
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,400
Well, in the foreword, we get some information through both Eric's notes to Jen and the

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,560
footnotes of Ship of Theseus itself, written by editor and translator FX Caldera.

58
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,640
FXC is just as mysterious as Straka.

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,600
Eric says that every serious scholar thinks the annotations in Ship of Theseus were written

60
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,600
by either a complete crank or VMS himself.

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Neither figure gave public interviews, and FXC never translated for anyone else.

62
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,080
The FX is believed to stand for either Francesco or Philip Shibregas, depending on source,

63
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,720
according to Eric, but no one knows.

64
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,080
They are known to be Brazilian, and must have arrived in New York sometime between 1924

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,260
and 1929, based on the fact they translated the last 13 of Straka's novels.

66
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,260
They were seemingly the only employee of Straka's publisher Karsten Sons, and started

67
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,300
Wing Shoes Press after his death in order to publish Ship of Theseus.

68
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,140
They personally claim to have communicated with Straka only via letters and notes in

69
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,320
the margins of his manuscripts, i.e. they never met him, nor knew his identity.

70
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,700
After Straka's death, FXC is believed to have returned to Brazil and died in the 60s.

71
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,540
As for Straka himself, within the world of S, he is one of the most famous slash infamous

72
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,120
authors of the early 20th century.

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,980
Press linked him to rumors of sabotage, espionage, conspiracy, subversion, larceny, and assassination,

74
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:53,180
and were given a list of outlandish crimes he was accused of on page 11.

75
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,900
Although it would be easy to disregard Theseus' myth, leaked documents apparently show that

76
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,620
multiple governments did want Straka dead.

77
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,300
He hardly released any public statements, and said he believed the authorship controversy

78
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,580
was misguided, not to mention a pernicious threat to his safety, liberty, and peace of

79
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,580
mind.

80
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,800
While he wrote a letter criticising the film adaptation of his novel The Santana March,

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,160
included as the earliest insert in S, we get the impression he liked to write about the

82
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,640
exploitation of capitalism, surrealist or fantastical settings, and protagonists being

83
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,920
philosophically angsty, all of which feature in Ship of Theseus.

84
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,520
In terms of solid facts, his novels are written in many different languages, but Ship of Theseus

85
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,760
specifically was written in Czech, according to Caldera.

86
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,340
Eric does confirm in the forward notes that Desjardins 1982 proved Straka wasn't truly

87
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,740
polylingual and genuinely needed a translator, giving FXC some credibility.

88
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,500
One of the most important events FXC describes is their account of the 1946 Havana incident,

89
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,380
i.e. Straka's assumed death.

90
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,980
They apparently received a telegram in May 1946 from Straka, asking them to meet at the

91
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,460
Hotel San Sebastian in Havana so he could give them the manuscript for Ship of Theseus

92
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,900
chapter 10.

93
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,860
The message hinted that he could not write the final lines without the two of us discussing

94
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,540
them in person, which would indicate they did share a close relationship.

95
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:17,140
FXC arrived on 5th June and was told he was out, but at midnight they started to get worried

96
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,820
and so entered his room.

97
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,820
There they saw

98
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,540
Chairs splintered, a table overturned, holes and slashes in the plastered walls, clothing

99
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,580
strewn, a wandered typewriter upside down on the floor, blood on the windowsill, and

100
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,540
the window opened to a three-storey fall into an alley.

101
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,380
Below the window, two men in police uniforms, loading a blanket-rolled body into the back

102
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,860
of a truck and carting it away.

103
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,820
FXC didn't follow the truck, citing their own shock and grief, but afterwards managed

104
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,820
to collect themselves and some pages of the chapter 10 manuscript floating about the room.

105
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,300
The final chapter of Ship of Theseus novel is mostly constructed from these pages, with

106
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,340
the end written by FXC.

107
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:04,100
Eric hates that FXC never admitted which pages are Strachas, and some scholars theorise

108
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,300
they may have made up the account of his death entirely.

109
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,100
The other important thing FXC does in the foreword is give us a list of the most popular

110
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,740
Stracha candidates, but we're going to come back to that in the next video section.

111
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,540
Otherwise, that's the foreword.

112
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,260
Jen, Eric, Caldera and Stracha.

113
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,380
These are the four names we will be referencing a lot.

114
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,980
From now on, Jen and Eric write in three different colour combinations, blue and black, then

115
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,260
yellow and green, then purple and red.

116
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,340
We know this is the chronological order, because Jen and Eric will often add on to previous

117
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
notes.

118
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,180
So let's go through the remainder of the blue-black phase.

119
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,300
Jen soon starts to suspect that some of FXC's footnotes may exist to hide ciphers intended

120
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,900
for Stracha, so she dives into research and manages to discover previously unknown information

121
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,560
about FXC remarkably quickly.

122
00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:00,480
This includes a name, Philomila Xabregas Caldera, making her not a man like most academics assumed.

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,440
Jen finds this via a manifest for a ship named Imperia, which had her down as a crew member

124
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,840
and translator on multiple trips between Brazil and New York in the 1920s.

125
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,560
Jump to November 1959, and this name is on another passenger manifest, from New York

126
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,200
back to São Paulo.

127
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,760
Besides these, there are virtually no traces.

128
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,560
She doesn't seem to have returned to the US, and Wingshoe's press was evicted for

129
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,360
non-payment in January 1960.

130
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,620
The only other record is her obituary, posted in Fioranova in 1964.

131
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,100
But this obituary is incredibly suspicious, because the only proof of death is a photo

132
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,880
of an unmarked headstone that the photographer claims is Caldera's.

133
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,960
So our peers start to wonder, is it possible that FXC could still be alive?

134
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,160
She would be over a hundred in their present, so it's unlikely, but she may at least have

135
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
lived past 1964.

136
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,100
Additionally, Jen is starting to suspect, based on Philomila's anecdotes, that she

137
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,100
and Straca may have been romantically involved, despite never meeting.

138
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,680
Going back to VMS, a couple of important events during his lifetime are mentioned here that

139
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,160
will become extremely relevant later.

140
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,900
Firstly, the Pre-Bouchard.

141
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:18,800
In September 1912, Straca was offered a prestigious literary prize that was sponsored by businessman

142
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,600
Hermes Bouchard.

143
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,280
But Straca refused the award, and infamously sent a tufted capuchin monkey to accept it

144
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,600
in his stead.

145
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,440
This act is essentially what started his whole anarchist wildcard reputation, and we'll

146
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,200
talk about it a lot more in the next section.

147
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,780
Secondly, Straca had an agent before FXC called Louis Luper.

148
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,360
Although maybe he didn't, because Luper completely disappeared in 1930.

149
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,920
However, in 1925, Luper auctioned off several of Straca's possessions, including 19 obsidian

150
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,000
pieces and a whistle with this S symbol carved on it.

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,200
Now, these artifacts were apparently from a, bear with me here, 17th century shipwreck

152
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,480
which buried a sailor called Archimedes de Sobrero.

153
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,840
Sobrero is another mysterious author who supposedly wrote a book called The Archer's

154
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,140
although most people think neither existed.

155
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,700
Until Jen finds proof that they did on page 21, and that's all we need to know for now.

156
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,740
Eric says most of these pieces and the whistle are currently kept in the Prague-Straca archive,

157
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,620
one of a few around the world.

158
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,660
The third important event to know about, or rather, events, is a series of 15-20 unsolved

159
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,860
murders occurring between the 1930s and 1970s.

160
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,720
Each of these involved an anonymous body washing ashore with no clear cause of death,

161
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,320
no ID, no fingerprints, and carrying a page from a Straca novel.

162
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,960
The first was found in 1936 in Santorini, Greece, and so we're going to refer to them

163
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,080
as the Santorini Man Deaths.

164
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,760
Throughout this, we continue to learn more about Jen and Eric as they start to open up

165
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,000
to each other.

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,120
Jen is in limbo at the moment, not knowing exactly what she wants to do with her life.

167
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,000
She just got dumped by her boyfriend of three years over email during spring break and doesn't

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,280
have many friends.

169
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,880
Her well-off dad has arranged a marketing job for her in New York, starting two months

170
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
after graduation.

171
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,480
She has to take it, but doesn't really want to.

172
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,880
The only thing she really likes is research, and she soon starts neglecting her coursework

173
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,600
in favour of reading Straca's books instead.

174
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,120
Eric, meanwhile, gives further details about his time at PSU.

175
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,040
Turns out he came there specifically to work with Moody, against advice.

176
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,800
Moody was always hard to please, but Eric trusted him until just before the Christmas

177
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,680
party disaster.

178
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,220
Since being in hospital, he has been frantically focused on work, neglecting to sleep and living

179
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,240
off almost nothing in a small place south of the tracks.

180
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,380
And he has been using steam tunnels to get around campus unseen, so again, not doing

181
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,380
very well.

182
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,980
In fact, Eric has also recently been in a bad relationship.

183
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,860
He admits on page 74 to having been involved with another of Moody's PhD students before

184
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,380
she betrayed him, a woman called Ilsa Dirks, who is a teaching assistant for one of Jen's

185
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,380
classes.

186
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,780
So our two scribblers bond over this mutual feeling of betrayal, and also being distant

187
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,260
from their families.

188
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,340
Eric doesn't have a great relationship with his parents, and doesn't explain why yet.

189
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,760
But Jen does explain.

190
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,660
She says her parents were very protective growing up, because once when she was seven

191
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,780
she wandered off and everyone thought she was kidnapped.

192
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,940
Their subsequent treatment of her as fragile influenced Jen's self-image, and there's

193
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,940
some mild resentment and emotional distance on both sides.

194
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,540
It's at this point in their bonding when Jen suggests the two actually meet up in person.

195
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,020
But Eric turns her down and then later doesn't show up.

196
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,700
Essentially, he's scared, because he clearly likes Jen and isn't great with people.

197
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,860
So there's a bit of back and forth for a while.

198
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,180
But thankfully not too much.

199
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,980
They both end up sweetly sharing their feelings on page 83, and from this point on they are

200
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,100
officially Jerrick.

201
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,500
But still no meetup.

202
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,640
Now that Eric trusts Jen, he reveals on page 64 what this whole Moody fight was about.

203
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,400
The Summersby tape.

204
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,460
This tape features a man called Victor M. Summersby, who is on the list of Straka suspects,

205
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,180
confessing to being VMS.

206
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,020
Eric tracked it down from the daughter of Summersby's lawyer, but after he returned, Moody got Ilsa

207
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,340
to steal it.

208
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,200
This is why Eric felt betrayed, and lashed out at Moody.

209
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,600
The tape was recorded in 1952, so after Havana, right before Summersby himself died by supposedly

210
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,920
falling off a ship.

211
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,200
However, at the tape's end there is a knock, followed by some unintelligible words.

212
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,840
So that's another suspicious death.

213
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,000
Eric gives Jen the transcript, but says that it isn't credible enough for him to go public,

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,080
and besides, he's starting to doubt Summersby's confession anyway.

215
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,000
So Eric is concerned about Moody and Ilsa finding out that Jen is now involved.

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,360
Again, Jen is in Ilsa's class.

217
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,240
On one occasion, Jen sees Moody and Ilsa together at a cafe called the Pronghorn Java, and has

218
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,400
to quickly hide her Straka novel.

219
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,720
She also sees Ilsa wearing one of Straka's obsidian pieces as a necklace, which is interesting

220
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,280
because the Prague Archive just reported a few of these missing.

221
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,900
The stakes are raised on page 74, because Jen is asked at work by Ilsa to provide a

222
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,360
list of everyone who has accessed the library archive.

223
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,840
Jen's name is all over these records, and so she tries to stall it first, but eventually

224
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,320
Ilsa emails her boss, and she has to send them.

225
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,960
Before she does, though, she sees that four unknown people have been inside the archive,

226
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,200
using VIP visitor cards.

227
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,080
Two went in with Ilsa and Moody, but two others went alone.

228
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,680
This ties in with several other unnerving occurrences around campus, suggesting that

229
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,600
Moody and Ilsa might not be the only ones here with an agenda.

230
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,560
Speaking of, at some point in this phase, Eric gets a cheque in the mailroom from something

231
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,280
called the Seren Institute, offering him funding.

232
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,320
Eric has never heard of this group, but they apparently saw him present a paper at a Straka

233
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,880
conference in Lisbon two years ago.

234
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,120
So he decides not to questions luck and takes the money.

235
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,880
That's all the blue-black notes, now it's time to move to the yellow-green.

236
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,800
This middle phase handily has more notes in the middle of the book, compared to the start

237
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
or end.

238
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,000
It also includes some of the biggest finds for Jen and Eric about VMS and the history

239
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,880
of this world, so we'll be coming back to those in part three.

240
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,460
Things are picking up in Pollard.

241
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,080
First off, Ilsa tells Jen she knows she is working with Eric, although Jen denies it.

242
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,600
Also, Moody is going to release his book in one month, giving Jen and Eric a ticking clock.

243
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,960
However, they are starting to question Summersby as Straka for a few reasons, not least because

244
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,320
Summersby claimed on the tape that he did his own translations, and they know FXC is

245
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,560
real now.

246
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,920
So since that is Moody's theory, they need to either prove him wrong or discredit him

247
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,320
by proving he got the tape unethically.

248
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,840
Also, more Straka artifacts are going missing, including the whistle that was in Prague.

249
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:07,440
Meanwhile, Jen is not doing well academics-wise because she has stopped attending classes.

250
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,400
She is totally disillusioned and feels like she has no purpose, warming up to the idea

251
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,360
of just running away to Paris with Eric and or going to grad school.

252
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,200
Worse than this though, she apparently has some kind of disciplinary hearing coming up

253
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,920
where she'll need to testify against Ilsa, but we don't know why.

254
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,640
Amidst all this, Jen wants to break into Moody's office and steal back the Summersby tape and

255
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,680
missing artifacts, but Eric thinks this will cause trouble and for a while she drops the

256
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,920
subject.

257
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,080
In a complete reversal, Eric is doing great, now he has money.

258
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,680
He makes three important trips during this phase.

259
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,560
The first is to New York for an auction, which has a photo of the Havana scene in 1946.

260
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,480
Afterwards, Eric mentions that Ilsa was there and also a mysterious agent bidding on behalf

261
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
of someone anonymous.

262
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,600
While there, he meets an important character, Jean Bernard Desjardins.

263
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,280
You might recall that Desjardins is an old Straka academic, he's that one guy in Paris

264
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,640
from the forward.

265
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,960
His main theory is that Straka was part of the S-Organisation, a secret writers' collective

266
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,880
with ties to political activism.

267
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,720
Desjardins was Moody's thesis advisor, but the two don't get along anymore.

268
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,680
Desjardins talks with Eric in New York, but afterwards ignores his calls, so Eric considers

269
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,040
going to Paris to try and meet him again with funding from Serin.

270
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,800
However, before he can, two things happen.

271
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,400
First, he receives a package containing documents, a note from Desjardins and one of the obsidian

272
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
pieces.

273
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,800
The letter, included as an insert on page 86, claims he is giving Eric these out of

274
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,480
fear for their security and he can't say more for safety reasons.

275
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,080
But the language of the letter is strange.

276
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,360
Eric says the English is less fluent than Desjardins seemed capable of.

277
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,880
Shortly after this, Desjardins suddenly dies.

278
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,560
He falls from the balcony of Hôtel des Deux Martres, so instead of going to Paris to meet

279
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,040
him, Eric attends his funeral with funding from Serin.

280
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,520
And what do you know, he reports back that no one who knew Desjardins believes he killed

281
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
himself.

282
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,440
Also, during the service someone sneaks Eric an invitation to a strange dinner with a bunch

283
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,960
of other scholars.

284
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,280
He can't tell whether they are connected to Serin and doesn't want to ask.

285
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,220
They certainly don't seem to trust Moody, but they also unsubtly talk up how committed

286
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,080
Desjardins was to sharing all his findings, which could insinuate much.

287
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,480
Another noteworthy thing is that Elsa is present at the funeral.

288
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,120
However, when Eric brags to her about his funding, which is stupid by the way, her reaction

289
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,000
suggests she might be there without Moody's knowledge.

290
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,280
Interesting.

291
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,640
The third trip is in April, when Eric decides to go to Brazil to find FXC.

292
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,600
Through multiple cryptic postcards, we track his journey between April 12th and 20th.

293
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,800
First, he finds Caldera's cousins in her hometown L'Ensoir, and they tell him she

294
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,640
came back but left again in the early 60s.

295
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,400
He follows more clues to reach a town called Maro, where shockingly enough, he finds Caldera

296
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
alive.

297
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,720
She has been hiding there for years under the name Ermalinda Pega.

298
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,480
A few people have been helping to protect and take care of her, including her main guy

299
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,720
named Arturo, but Eric says she was still very sharp mentally, enough to answer some

300
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,120
questions.

301
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,480
Unfortunately though, she maintains that the foreword was true and she never met Straca.

302
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,040
Eric describes Caldera as wistful when speaking of him, but ultimately, she has come to terms

303
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,680
with how it all ended.

304
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,440
When Eric tells her about how he and Jen have been using the book though, she is thrilled.

305
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,360
As he leaves, she wishes him luck and says, don't make the same mistake we did.

306
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,000
Before Brazil, Eric was in fact doing exactly that, and still refusing to meet up with Jen.

307
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,840
However, after having a heart to heart with himself, he writes her a letter on page 203

308
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,360
about his past.

309
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,280
This Eric backstory explains how he got into Straca in the first place.

310
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,000
It started when he was 16.

311
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,340
He was suffering from bad insomnia and depression and became distanced from religion.

312
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,220
His uncle Zeke took him on a boat trip up the coast to help, but Eric had a series of

313
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,220
panic attacks and ended up bailing half way after they had an argument.

314
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,380
While he was heading home alone, Zeke got into a wreck and died, and Eric's parents

315
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,820
blamed him.

316
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,420
But that day was when he first read Straca, so VMS is tied to the most difficult time

317
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,780
of his life.

318
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,980
Telling Jen all this seems to give Eric some catharsis and clarity, and he finally agrees

319
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,580
to meet at the Varsity Cinema right before leaving for Brazil.

320
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,900
However, Jen doesn't show this time because she's ill, leaving them without a way to

321
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,740
contact each other, hence the postcards.

322
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,020
After Eric returns, they both realise that Philomela was onto something, and Jen echoes

323
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,900
her sentiment, let's not make the same mistakes Philo and Straca did.

324
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,900
While Jen and Eric make these breakthroughs, the mysterious figures hanging around Pollard

325
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,540
start to act.

326
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,220
Jen has seen them three times, including during Elsa's class, and starts suspecting that

327
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,340
her mail has been tampered with.

328
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:55,620
An S symbol appears on the side of the Varsity, which neither Jen nor Eric put there.

329
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,300
At some point, someone follows Jen home from the library, prompting her to use the same

330
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,460
steam tunnels as Eric.

331
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,260
And then, on page 308, the pair discover that the Santorini Man deaths have begun again,

332
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,980
with one as recent as last October.

333
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,940
Things culminate when several fires occur near Jen.

334
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,420
This is first mentioned on page 128, and Eric thinks they might be diversions, but a bigger

335
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,300
fire is alluded to on page 258.

336
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,300
It seems as though at some point, there is a fire at a motel Jen is staying at while

337
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,420
scared to be in her apartment, and then another at her parents' barn while she is visiting.

338
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,980
The motel fires teased much earlier than the barn, so this series of events is pretty confusing

339
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,100
for a while, but Jen mentions on page 263 that while they were at the motel watching

340
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,580
the fire, there was a guy who kept looking at her.

341
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,580
She doesn't know whether he was involved, but it's because of him she went to her parents'

342
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,980
place, and she's worried that he followed her.

343
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,540
An S-symbol is visible on the barn wall after the fire, so this intimidation is clearly

344
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,540
targeted.

345
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,700
Okay, so we have some building tension stepping into the purple-red phase.

346
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,220
Just like the yellow-green phase takes up most of the middle of S, these are the most

347
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,540
prevalent colours in the later third.

348
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:11,020
The more romantic colours prove appropriate, as it's confirmed on page 248 that Jerec

349
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
finally meets.

350
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,340
This seems very sweet, and we get continuing anecdotes of them meeting on page 280 and

351
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,340
290.

352
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,340
The romance is flourishing.

353
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,020
However, this is interrupted briefly when Jen decides to reveal in another letter that

354
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,660
the whole story about her childhood disappearance earlier was actually a total lie.

355
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,060
The truth is a bit more complicated.

356
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,180
Turns out she deliberately disappeared during to feeling emotionally neglected by her parents

357
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,460
after her brother died.

358
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,020
The truth is a bit more complicated.

359
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,820
Turns out she deliberately disappeared due to feeling emotionally neglected by her parents

360
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,860
after her brother died, and spent several days hiding before giving herself up to the

361
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,140
police, alongside another runaway who helped her.

362
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,740
So both her and Jerec feel guilty.

363
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,720
This reframes her complicated relationship with her parents.

364
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,780
If she rebels against their wishes for her future now, she's choosing to run from them

365
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,820
again.

366
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,080
So she wonders whether it's worth it.

367
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,160
Jen apologises to Jerec for lying, but he's pretty understanding, and to be honest this

368
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,900
whole plot thread has very little impact on the book, besides giving Doris a reason to

369
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,080
include more inserts, so there's no need to remember any of it.

370
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,040
Eventually Jen decides to reject the job, and begs Jerec for them to leave Pollard together

371
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,880
away from the danger, again mirroring Straka and Caldera.

372
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,360
Running does seem reasonable when the trouble facing Jen and Jerec starts to build on multiple

373
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
fronts.

374
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,840
Lastly from the uni, we find out what Jen's hearing against Ilsa is about.

375
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,120
If reading is front to back, we learn on page 23 that Jen has been accused of something,

376
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:48,120
but it's not until 318 when Erik gives Jen a paper to use in Ilsa's class that we can

377
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,080
guess it's plagiarism.

378
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,320
Additionally, Jen gets fired from the library, which she suspects is because of one of the

379
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,080
people on the special collection logs.

380
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,160
Speaking of which, remember how Jen was tempted to break into Moody's office earlier?

381
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,920
Well, turns out that's back on the table.

382
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,480
Given everything else happening, you may be thinking, why would she do that?

383
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
And Erik agrees.

384
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,920
But Jen is fuelled by her righteous anger towards Moody stealing all these artefacts,

385
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,320
and so goes ahead and reports her findings on page 355.

386
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,640
Moody does indeed have one of the obsidian pieces, but not a physical copy of the Summersby

387
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,000
tape or the Archer's Tales, like Jen suspected.

388
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,720
Although she does see a schematic suggesting that Moody is preparing to store something

389
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,960
new in the library, it's unknown what exactly, but the design suggests the object is either

390
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,880
very valuable or very delicate.

391
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,520
Jen swears to Erik that she didn't take or move anything, but the next day campus cops

392
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,560
are all over Moody's office.

393
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,800
A little earlier, on page 317, a picture of Erik was in the Daily Pronghorn, and we don't

394
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,120
know why at the time, but it now seems that he's likely a suspect when he notes,

395
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,560
I told you it was a terrible idea.

396
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,560
It is confirmed that the police do come to Erik's apartment, but he refuses entry without

397
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,600
a warrant, as he should.

398
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,840
This worries Jen that whoever is following her will now target Erik, but he reckons if

399
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,040
they haven't done anything so far, then they probably won't.

400
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,960
Jen though is seeing the men frequently, including outside her apartment.

401
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,360
The pair have been switching the book location around, and this is partially because scary

402
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,680
phrases in Ship of Theseus start being underlined independently, suggesting someone else is

403
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,120
aware of their communications.

404
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,720
It's at this point that Jen finally suggests they ditch the book and switch to email or

405
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,880
something, but Erik is reluctant.

406
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,080
He says it's because he likes having it as a scrapbook of ideas, but this is just door

407
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
slam shading.

408
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,640
At this point they really shouldn't be writing notes if other people are reading them.

409
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,400
Still, they brainstorm where they can meet without being seen together.

410
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,480
Being watched though is nothing.

411
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,720
Officials confirm that the barn fire was indeed arson, and police are watching over Jen due

412
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,400
to the proliferation of incidents.

413
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,840
Erik still thinks this is someone being paid by Moody to scare them, but Jen is quite rightfully

414
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,000
terrified and angry.

415
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,360
What finally shakes Erik is receiving an ominous letter from Arturo in Brazil apologising

416
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,880
that they had to turn away his colleague because he made FXC uneasy.

417
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,440
This implies that someone was tracking Erik the entire time he was in Brazil, which is

418
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,640
insane.

419
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,840
Then on page 251, Erik hears someone calling his name in the steam tunnels and sprints.

420
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,920
Jen does not trust her flat anymore after she returns to find her window open despite

421
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,280
leaving it closed.

422
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,360
I was too afraid to go near it in case I got pushed like Desjardins.

423
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,160
Eventually it's too much, and after hearing someone in her apartment she decides to leave.

424
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,240
Erik offers her his place, but she's worried about leading the men to him.

425
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,680
This brings us to the third strand of trouble, Jen's family.

426
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,320
A month before she's supposed to graduate, after the fire, her parents announce a surprise

427
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,760
sudden visit.

428
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,760
She calls her sister to find out why, and is told that her ex, Jacob, got in touch with

429
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,000
them, claiming he was worried about how she was acting.

430
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,400
He told them all about Erik and her academic crash out, and if that wasn't enough, her

431
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,600
sister also snitched about how Jen had a lot of crazy s*** when she came home.

432
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,800
When her parents finally show, they think Erik caused the fire and she can't convince

433
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
them otherwise.

434
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:16,000
The situation escalates drastically and they try to take her to a psych facility, but thankfully

435
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,680
she manages to run.

436
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,000
So now Jen essentially has to go into hiding at Erik's place after her dorm gets cleared

437
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,520
out.

438
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,060
So far everything has been going terribly, until Erik decides to finally confront Elsa.

439
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,800
It's implied on page 383 that he visits her, and it actually helps.

440
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,960
Afterwards Elsa suddenly drops the plagiarism accusation against Jen.

441
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,280
Apparently Erik told Elsa that Jen didn't use his paper, which is actually true.

442
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,580
Jen says afterwards she buckled down and wrote it after all, but Erik didn't know that.

443
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,100
He just had faith.

444
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,700
The fact Elsa believes him though, shows a surprising level of trust on her part.

445
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,900
During this conversation they manage to talk through their baggage and reach some sort

446
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,300
of understanding.

447
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,760
This shows how Erik has changed too.

448
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,540
He says he wasn't as angry at her as he expected.

449
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,100
A lot of that has faded since meeting Jen.

450
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,940
So he tells Elsa that at the end of the day, all of them are just trying to figure out

451
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,320
what they want.

452
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,460
She in turn admits she really doesn't care about Moody and is only in this for herself.

453
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,900
While Erik is mending bridges with Elsa, Moody makes a surprising move and contacts

454
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
him.

455
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,900
It's worth mentioning that for a while now, Moody has been consistently seen drunk around

456
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,900
town.

457
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,940
He leaves notes in the pronghorn java, and then the steam tunnel is asking Erik to call

458
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,700
him, to which Erik eventually decides to leave a note in return.

459
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,300
Moody responds with a letter.

460
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,700
He doesn't accept much blame, but says that if Erik gives him legal consent to use the

461
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,740
tape, he'll gladly give him credit for finding it.

462
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,060
Erik realises that Summersbee's lawyer's daughter must have told Moody's publisher

463
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,740
she gave the tape to Erik, so now Moody can't publish his book without Erik signing off.

464
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,340
This means Erik finally has leverage.

465
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,180
If he can get a meeting with the publisher, he might be able to tell her about his and

466
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,660
Jen's discoveries and dismantle Moody's theory.

467
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,260
Jen and Erik at this point have their own theory about who Strachat is, which we'll

468
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,140
get to, and think they can convince the publisher to back them instead.

469
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,780
Also, note that in this phase, Erik has been getting more money from Seren alongside a

470
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:21,020
photo of the Havana incident, and Jen does not trust them, and suspects Erik will soon

471
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,620
be asked to repay it somehow.

472
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:29,700
As we reach the 400 page mark, a lot of elements in the Jerek storyline pay off in short succession.

473
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,100
Although this slightly abandons the non-chronological framework, it does help the book feel like

474
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,380
it's reaching some sort of climax.

475
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,460
Jen and Erik plan to fly abroad together the minute Jen is finished with Uni, and have

476
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,900
the Seren Institute cover the tickets.

477
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,120
Newly motivated, Jen manages to get her act together and nails the final, meaning she

478
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,820
can definitely graduate.

479
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,780
However, the night before her exam, Erik gets a letter and package from Arturo.

480
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,940
He wants to come round, but Jen thinks she already knows what the letter says and doesn't

481
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,940
want to hear it.

482
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,660
Sure enough, we learn on page 414 that Philomila has died in her sleep.

483
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,660
She leaves them a sweet letter wishing them both love, but the true surprise comes from

484
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,440
what's inside the package.

485
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,620
The missing pages of Ship Odysseus, Chapter 10.

486
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:18,320
In another surprising turn, Erik's meeting with publisher Esme Emerson Plum does not

487
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
go well.

488
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,960
She wasn't buying their theory at all and says they're going to publish Moody's book

489
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,560
with or without Erik's permission.

490
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,480
Erik decides that he can't leave without confronting Moody in person, so he does so

491
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
on page 419.

492
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,680
It's a contrast to how Ilsa acted.

493
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,280
Moody is drunk and laughs at Erik, both when he asks about the guys following Jen and then

494
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,080
about the publishing going ahead.

495
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,920
Jen, however, decides to email the university provost and tell them that Moody has tried

496
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,880
to bribe her for access to the archives.

497
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,760
This is a lie, obviously, but she hopes it will allow them to find the stolen artefacts

498
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,040
in his office.

499
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,480
She also emails back and forth with her father about the whole hospital incident, during

500
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,520
which he officially cuts her off financially.

501
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,220
But Jen thinks this is fair enough.

502
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,520
She now has other priorities.

503
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,160
It's directly after they work together against Moody that Erik tells Jen he loves her for

504
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,360
the first time.

505
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,360
Appropriate.

506
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,360
The climax of the purple-red phase occurs on page 453.

507
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,860
Since Jen and Erik are meeting in person now, we have to read between the lines to understand

508
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,920
events they were both present for.

509
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,720
But what seems to happen is this.

510
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,560
While meeting in a planetarium, the projector goes out, and suddenly an unknown man is there

511
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
with them.

512
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,760
They get into some sort of physical altercation before the pair manages to make a break for

513
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,640
it and they end up fleeing the country early with almost no belongings.

514
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,560
Who this man was exactly and whether Jen and Erik are safe remains pretty ambiguous.

515
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,000
And that's where this phase ends.

516
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,080
Now, there is a small epilogue phase, the double black, which does give us insight into

517
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,160
where Jen and Erik end up.

518
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,840
However, before we circle back around to that, we have a lot of things to explain first about

519
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,600
Layer 2, because we need to understand that to understand why Jen and Erik's story ends

520
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,980
the way it does.

521
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,520
So what have we covered so far?

522
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,880
Essentially, if someone was to only read the handwritten notes of S and only paid attention

523
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,580
to what Jen and Erik get up to, this is what they would get.

524
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,560
By itself, it's a pretty neat little story.

525
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,360
It has romance, academic drama, plenty of tension.

526
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,120
But a lot of things don't make sense yet.

527
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,460
The main confusion is probably how exactly did these stakes become so high?

528
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,860
This clearly goes beyond Moody and Elsa.

529
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:35,820
There are other forces at play here related to VMS and this mysterious S symbol.

530
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:41,160
Thus, our next section of video will dive into the important details we skipped over.

531
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,840
What exactly did Jen and Erik discover about VMStrakka and the history of this world?

532
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,600
And why did they seem to be getting targeted because of it?

533
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,820
Can we ourselves make sense of it all?

534
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,860
Let's try to answer the question, who is VMStrakka?
