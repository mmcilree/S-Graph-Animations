1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
Just to recap some of what we learned back in the foreword.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:10,320
V.M. Stracca is the name used by an unknown author who wrote 19 books before his supposed death in 1946.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,540
The first was called A Miracle at Braxenholm, published in 1911,

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:22,560
and the last was this novel, Ship of Theseus, published after V.M.S. died by his translator and confident, F.X. Caldera.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,940
Much of what the world knows about Stracca are only rumours, including lists of politically motivated crimes he may have been involved in.

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,780
Caldera provides us with a list of the most popular theorised candidates in the foreword,

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,040
so let's take a look at this group of characters.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,240
Even from a passing glance, some of these suspects seem more believable than others.

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,060
Florence Stonem Smith, for one, is probably a no.

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,620
Juan Blas Colverubius, called the last Spanish pirate by some, and almost certainly fictional by Caldera,

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,360
is referenced in a couple of footnotes and also in Ship of Theseus itself,

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,660
but these seem more like an in-joke between Philo and Stracca.

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,720
Apis Amenuensis.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,420
This refers to a real theory that the leader of the Black Hand Gang had a mysterious Iago-like aide

15
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,120
who influenced the decision to assassinate Franz Ferdinand II.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,540
Within S, some people think this could be Stracca,

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,420
but we believe this relies on misinterpreting the interlude of Ship of Theseus,

18
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,700
and besides, it's just another pseudonym.

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,020
So, with those out the way, it's time to talk about the S organisation.

20
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,700
As mentioned earlier, it was Desjardins who originally came up with the theory

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,120
that there may have existed a secret organisation of writers called the S,

22
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,280
consisting of many Stracca candidates.

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,420
Really, the biggest evidence for this is that some suspects are clearly the basis

24
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,240
for a group of characters featured in Ship of Theseus.

25
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,260
Their appearances apparently match, and they all have bird-inspired names,

26
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,220
which share the language with the candidates' nationalities.

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,020
Thus, whether or not one of them is Stracca, they are significant.

28
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,200
So, let's do a quick round-up.

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,680
First, the oldest of the bunch, Torsten Ekström.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,800
A rather successful Swedish author of children's books,

31
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,080
he's automatically a suspect because Summersby named him

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,380
the co-author of Miracle at Braxenholm in the Summersby tape.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,740
Obviously, Summersby could have been lying,

34
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,420
but Desjardins firmly believed that Ekström was involved in the S,

35
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,180
even if he doubted he was Stracca.

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,280
Also, he is the fourth person to die suspiciously falling from a balcony,

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,040
dying in 1931.

38
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,640
In fact, it was from Hotel des deux Martres,

39
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,020
the same hotel as Desjardins.

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,460
On page 161, we find out that Ekström was apparently in good spirits,

41
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,060
of vigorous mind, and about to return to work after a bad illness.

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,160
At the scene, authorities found a sheet of paper

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,160
with hundreds of anagrams written on it in many different languages,

44
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,780
including ones Ekström did not speak.

45
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,860
Next up is Amarante Durand, the only female candidate.

46
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,540
She wrote at least one novel, but made her name as an archaeologist.

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,740
She famously discovered a cave in the Dordogne containing ancient paintings,

48
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,360
which is referenced in Chapter 4 of Ship of Theseus.

49
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,060
Her and Ekström's character analogues in Ship of Theseus are unmarried lovers,

50
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,160
and evidence points to this being true in life as well.

51
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,820
On page 217, we get confirmation that Ekström visited her in Egypt in 1921,

52
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,080
and, as we'll soon see, they often met other S members as a pair.

53
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,400
After his death, she moved to Spain and threw herself into various work,

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,420
including suffrage, labour protests, and spying in the lead-up to the Spanish Civil War.

55
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,680
It's the latter that got her killed,

56
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,720
as it's mentioned earlier that Durand was shot by Franco's troops near Madrid in 1937.

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,880
Although, interestingly, she may have been thrown from a roof first, adding to the pattern.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,520
We also know Durand was rumoured to be close to VMS.

59
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,420
FXC seems to dislike Durand for this reason,

60
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,760
but whether there's actually any merit to her jealousy, we'll judge later.

61
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,040
Segwaying nicely, we have Tiago García Ferrara.

62
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,360
Out of the candidates, Tiago has both the saddest life and biggest fall from grace.

63
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,800
Eric tells us within the first few chapters that he sold out to the fascists,

64
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,440
and on page 173, that's explained.

65
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,640
After fighting on the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War for years,

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,200
Ferrara turned coat and sold out Durand in order to protect his family.

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,400
They had been friends, too, writing to each other regularly in the 1930s.

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,920
However, even without knowing more about this incident, it's hard not to feel bad for Tiago.

69
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,900
He was outcast from society after the war, which coincided with the death of his son.

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,340
FXC describes him as very sensitive, and he lived with a shattered heart,

71
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,160
becoming depressed and eventually hanging himself.

72
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,080
So this Spanish incident was bad all round.

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,560
Completely uninvolved in this was Reinhold Feuerbach.

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,140
The last of the four candidates who have clear ship of Theseus counterparts.

75
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,220
On paper, we know the least about him, but he does seem the most overtly political of the bunch,

76
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,560
being described as an anarchist and polemicist above anything else.

77
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,720
He's about the same age as Ekstrom, so older than the others,

78
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,920
and it's suggested that he may have been involved in the 1886 Haymarket bombing,

79
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,020
i.e. one of the events VMS was accused of.

80
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,980
Most of the information we get about him is from a German magazine article Eric tells us about.

81
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,280
In 1937, he was living in Germany, supported by anarchist groups who revered him for Haymarket,

82
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,140
but soon fled the Nazis to Dublin, where he died in 1940 after a fall in his home.

83
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,060
The only other thing we know is that for decades he travelled with a man called Horst Weschler.

84
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,740
He was described as his secretary and protege.

85
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,180
To a non-historian, it may seem more likely they were lovers, and Eric concurs.

86
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,400
Upon Foyback's death, Weschler said about the Stracca identity rumours,

87
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,080
if there were answers inside him, those answers are gone.

88
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,220
Very helpful.

89
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,020
Alright, so if you've been paying a superhuman amount of attention so far,

90
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,700
you'll notice that all these four died before the novels were finished,

91
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,040
except for the heavily traumatised Ferrara.

92
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,540
However, the same is not true for the last two major candidates.

93
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,820
First up is someone we've already mentioned, Victor Martin Summersby.

94
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:11,020
Summersby was a popular pulp novelist and screenwriter whose work Eric and Jen both enjoy.

95
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,460
He not only has the initials VMS, but is the only American of the bunch,

96
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,720
and many of the settings and influences of Stracca's novels apparently seem American,

97
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,600
though Shippetheseus does not.

98
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,900
FXC says he was the only friend of VMS's that she knew well,

99
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,340
which both ties him to this group well, also kind of ruling him out Stracca-wise.

100
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,660
Although Summersby doesn't have a proper character in Shippetheseus,

101
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,740
there is a little nod to him in Chapter 10.

102
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,560
An old sailor who looks identical to him in the 1940s.

103
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,720
Our last big name is arguably the most canonically popular candidate,

104
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,060
Guthrie McInnes.

105
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,240
We don't hear much about McInnes from Jarek until after the 200-page mark,

106
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,740
aside from there being a very well-funded group supporting his authorship,

107
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,800
and mentioning he was good at spreading the money around.

108
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,800
Eventually, though, we get a small biography from Eric on page 225.

109
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,240
McInnes was a philosophy wunderkind,

110
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,600
one of Oxford's youngest dons and then a well-known television figure.

111
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,900
He wrote a number of books, but Eric says his radicalism faded with age.

112
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,080
His trademark philosophy is something called multitudinalism,

113
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,240
but this is hard to judge independently because it's only mentioned when Eric and FXC make fun of it.

114
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,040
It seems to argue there is no such thing as a true self and art cannot be made with just one vision,

115
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,000
but Eric claims if there's no real self, there's no moral responsibility,

116
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,180
so you can just do whatever you want, which is telling.

117
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,960
FXC was also adamant that McInnes's nihilism is in strict opposition to Stracka's tangible yearning for meaning.

118
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,160
Jen describes McInnes's novel, A Swindle of Cowbirds,

119
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,720
as a thinly veiled hatchet job on writers he knew, i.e. other candidates.

120
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,700
So overall, he's the kind of guy nothing bad ever happened to.

121
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,560
Jerk.

122
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,980
And indeed, McInnes died peacefully of old age in 1969, unlike the others.

123
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:02,340
The only other candidate to mention is not on this list, but is named in the foreword.

124
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,360
Vaclav Stracka.

125
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,280
Not to state the obvious, but that guy's name is Stracka.

126
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,260
FXC mentions Vaclav mostly to rule him out,

127
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,560
as his biography starts with him being born in 1892 in South Bohemia,

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,600
and ends with him committing suicide in Prague in 1910.

129
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,160
So that's unfortunate.

130
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,720
Despite this, we do get more information about Vaclav in a chapter 3 footnote,

131
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,020
plus a newspaper insert about his death.

132
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,960
These clarify that he was a young, ill-educated factory worker.

133
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,840
He jumped off the Charles Bridge,

134
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,440
and despite someone apparently trying to rescue him,

135
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,240
there was no signs he survived.

136
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,100
Another worker says he jumped due to being turned down by a girl,

137
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,040
although Eric thinks this could be a lie.

138
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,160
There are some suspicious details.

139
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,380
Vaclav had fallen under the influence of syndicalists,

140
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,600
and he was trying to distribute literature even right before the jump.

141
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,240
Furthermore, he may have wanted to be a writer.

142
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,800
Some people, including Moody, claim that even if he did survive,

143
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,500
VMS couldn't possibly be Vaclav because of his little education.

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,180
But this is a bad argument,

145
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,520
possibly a reference by Dorst to the Shakespeare authorship debate.

146
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,720
Equally, though, we can't just say,

147
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,140
well, since Shakespeare is Shakespeare, then Stracka must be Stracka.

148
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,920
These are all interesting details, but alone, it's still a stretch.

149
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,260
Aside from the complexities of faking your own death with witnesses,

150
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,940
how does someone go from here to starting a publishing company?

151
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,040
It could be one of these writers just took this young dead radical's name as a pseudonym,

152
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,880
like a martyr.

153
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,580
Now, it's recognised that some of these people definitely knew each other.

154
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,880
Ekstrom and Durand, and Durand and Ferrara.

155
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,740
Feuerbach and Weschler seem separate, since they weren't even novelists.

156
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,440
But there's a well-known photo from 1937,

157
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,400
which features Durand, Ferrara, Weschler,

158
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,940
and a person turned away from the camera.

159
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Immediately, if Weschler was there, then Ferrara probably was too,

160
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,820
so there's another connection.

161
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,260
But is this other person Ferrara, or perhaps VMS?

162
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,460
Currently, we have three options.

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,220
One, one of these people was Stracka.

164
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,160
Two, they all worked together as the S organisation to create Stracka's books.

165
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,900
And three, Stracka is someone else,

166
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,520
who was either part of this S organisation or knew all of them separately.

167
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,100
None of the candidates fit perfectly with being VMS,

168
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,760
based on only the info so far.

169
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,640
Most were not alive early or late enough.

170
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,880
For now, let's take a look at number two,

171
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,160
and imagine that they were somehow all involved.

172
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,160
After all, Somersby did claim to co-write the first VMS-attributed book with Ekstrom,

173
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,620
and it's mentioned several times that these novels vary drastically

174
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,860
in prose style, philosophy, and genre.

175
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,960
VMS wrote 19 books,

176
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,260
helpfully listed here on the inside cover.

177
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,460
Are there any which seem more connected to a specific candidate?

178
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,400
Yes.

179
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,020
Eric says that both Night Palisades and The Santana March have similarities to Somersby's prose,

180
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,500
and The Santana March getting a film adaptation also fits his work.

181
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,840
A couple of the other novels have obvious plot connections to the Stracka candidates.

182
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,680
The blurb of The Square matches Farback and The Haymarket Massacre,

183
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,980
and The Painted Cave has details that can only come from Durand.

184
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,380
Triptych of Mirrors is apparently the worst and most disjointed Stracka book,

185
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,420
in a way that resembles McInnes.

186
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,160
Which is strange, because McInnes is one of the most plausible Stracka candidates dates-wise,

187
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,760
but this seems to be his only VMS novel.

188
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,180
100 Aprils and Amritsar also has a clear author, but we'll come back to that,

189
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,700
and likewise for Washington and Green, which has an almost identical structure.

190
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:34,000
As for the others, though, those don't have an obvious author.

191
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,900
Eric describes the Black 19 as an outlier,

192
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,540
with not much overlap in material or style with other VMS books.

193
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,080
Some books are only mentioned in one or two footnotes and don't mention plot details,

194
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,260
and Hanging the Dead isn't mentioned at all, so who knows for those.

195
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,580
The final three Stracka books prior to Ship of Theseus are mentioned quite frequently,

196
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,640
but nothing obviously lines up.

197
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,540
These all seem to share more elements with Ship of Theseus than with other novels,

198
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,800
especially Coriolis.

199
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,460
And of course, there's the very first, Miracle at Braxenholm,

200
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,440
which we also can't attribute yet,

201
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,220
although Eric thinks the tone is pretty young-sounding.

202
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,620
Unfortunately, since Ekstrom didn't normally write for adults,

203
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,460
and we're missing details about his life,

204
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,120
it's very hard to guess what he may have been involved with,

205
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,080
even though context suggests he must have had a hand in something.

206
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,040
So all these individual ties further the idea that the candidates work together,

207
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,240
but it doesn't explain how this all started and why.

208
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,800
And ultimately, it doesn't matter hugely if the books were co-written or not,

209
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,100
because that doesn't identify who Caldera Stracka was,

210
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,240
the person writing to her all this time,

211
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,120
the one who wrote Ship of Theseus after most of the others were dead.

212
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,980
So who was this person?

213
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,860
Well, we have lots of proof of who it can't be.

214
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,560
In the yellow-green phase,

215
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,820
Jen comes up with the idea of comparing different members' handwriting

216
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,900
to notes in the original Miracle at Braxton Home manuscript,

217
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,600
which Eric has pictures of.

218
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,940
They're able to rule out Ekstrom, Durand, Ferrara, and Feuerbach.

219
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,640
So already, there must have been another who wrote the first novel.

220
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,380
Remember the Hotel Florida photo?

221
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,740
In Ferrara's personal papers,

222
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,160
Jen finds a letter from V. Finch,

223
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,020
dated 30th October 1937.

224
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:26,960
V. Finch is probably Somersby,

225
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,880
given the initial and bird-used.

226
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,860
So this rules out everyone named in the photo

227
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,340
and Somersby as not being VMS.

228
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,640
Speaking of secrecy,

229
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,720
why exactly does VMS need to stay secret anyway?

230
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,500
Well, turns out his eat-the-rich mentality

231
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,540
and penchant for uprisings makes very powerful enemies.

232
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,760
Not just governments,

233
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,860
but people whose wealth and influence could topple civilizations.

234
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,500
Reintroducing Hermes Bouchard,

235
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,880
the villain of S.

236
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,460
You may remember us mentioning the pre-Bouchard.

237
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,440
Well, that stunt started a lifelong rivalry.

238
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Bouchard inspired antagonists in both Wineblood's Mine

239
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,360
and Ship of Theseus.

240
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,760
He owned some kind of company that dissolved post-World War I

241
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,380
and lived in an estate of unknown location.

242
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,940
So here's the issue.

243
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,420
That monkey that Straca sent actually had a note pinned to it.

244
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,940
While newspapers at the time reported it simply reading

245
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,440
that Straca didn't like prizes,

246
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,620
Caldeira claims it was an accusation towards Bouchard.

247
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,760
Specifically, that he had orchestrated the deaths

248
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,120
of syndicalist agitators

249
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,560
and was behind a recent massacre of factory workers in Calais.

250
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,320
This is described by FXC in Chapter 4.

251
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,960
After the Calais massacre,

252
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,180
authorities declared that the bomb had been fashioned

253
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,620
from explosives stolen from the Bouchard factory.

254
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,760
This was, to a degree, true.

255
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,560
They'd been stolen from the factory

256
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,320
by workers encouraged to do so

257
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,420
by an agent who'd infiltrated their camp.

258
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,160
The agent then stole the dynamite back from them

259
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,100
and because it was traceable to the workers,

260
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,940
Bouchard's thugs were free to use it to do their worst,

261
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,560
with little risk of Bouchard's plans being discovered.

262
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,020
Eric says Straca's note was in Munich

263
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,720
until it disappeared in 1983 and quotes it.

264
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,100
You seek a world populated by trick monkeys

265
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,300
who dance to your tunes for the empty promise of coins.

266
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,380
Jen and FXC both seemed to agree

267
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,280
that this accusation defined the rest of Straca's life.

268
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,960
And when Eric met FXC,

269
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,660
she confirmed that everything goes back to Calais.

270
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,160
If this is true,

271
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,820
Bouchard might also be our most likely suspect

272
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,620
for the Santorini man murders.

273
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,880
This was at least Desjardins' theory.

274
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,880
But how exactly would Bouchard have that much influence

275
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,120
if his company ended?

276
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,380
Well, it kind of didn't.

277
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,160
It just went on to spawn and control

278
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,380
a bunch of shell companies,

279
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,960
creating quite a legacy in Jerick's present.

280
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,380
A particular footnote cipher

281
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,960
reveals one of these shells

282
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,060
is a Dutch weapons manufacturer

283
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,720
called Arp Syndicate.

284
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,880
They are not publicly connected,

285
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,820
but the first chairman of Arp was A.R. Prinsen,

286
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,180
a man who previously worked for Bouchard

287
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,000
at the Calais factory during 1912.

288
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,840
And that's not all about Arp.

289
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,740
In Ship of Theseus itself,

290
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,940
the Bouchard stand-in,

291
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,960
called Vevoda,

292
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,260
is working on some kind of strange

293
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,360
and frightening weapon.

294
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,540
And footnote 10 of chapter 4

295
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,600
suggests that both Caldera and Straca

296
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,700
thought that Bouchard was also.

297
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,400
Caldera believes including this information

298
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,980
in Ship of Theseus is dangerous,

299
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,480
which probably explains why she went into hiding.

300
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,740
Jen discovers evidence for this theory.

301
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,620
In February 1946,

302
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,720
there were reports of strange

303
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,700
indigo-coloured flashes in the sky

304
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,600
near the Dutch town of Volfica,

305
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,080
where the Arp Syndicate had a factory.

306
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,960
And there were accounts of weird smells

307
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,380
at the Calais-Bouchard factory

308
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,320
before the massacre,

309
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,600
which is also referenced in Ship of Theseus.

310
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,460
But Bouchard and the S both died decades ago.

311
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,800
Why would the Santorini man murders occur

312
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,180
until the 70s,

313
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,400
and why reappear now?

314
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,320
This is a great question we will return to.

315
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,780
For now, it's implied that Hermes Bouchard

316
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,980
had a son possibly creating an heir.

317
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,160
And Bouchard's wife killed herself

318
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,880
a month after the awards ceremony,

319
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,020
which might give all the Bouchards

320
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,960
a more personal grudge against Straca.

321
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,540
Going back to Straca, though,

322
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,060
in the yellow-green phase

323
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,620
while tracing Bouchard's companies,

324
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,360
Jen makes the most important series of findings

325
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,200
in the whole book.

326
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,320
First of all,

327
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,680
both that article describing Feuerbach

328
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,100
and the interview about Václav Straca's death

329
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,120
were in magazines owned by Bouchard.

330
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,560
But more importantly,

331
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,660
on October 30th, 1910,

332
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,660
the same day as the Prague Bridge Jump,

333
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,860
the names Stenfok, Corbeau,

334
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,260
and a Czech, Guest,

335
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,980
are registered in the nearby Hotel Volieri.

336
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,340
The next day,

337
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,060
the names Pfeiffer and Ostrero join,

338
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,260
and it's also confirmed

339
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,420
that the former was travelling with his secretary.

340
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,300
This is therefore huge,

341
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,460
the earliest and only record we have

342
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,660
of all these people meeting.

343
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,700
Plus, who could this guest be

344
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,120
except an alive Václav Straca?

345
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,320
If so,

346
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,700
Václav would be an untraceable man

347
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,760
with no connections

348
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,520
other than to this group of writers.

349
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,380
His candidacy now works on multiple levels.

350
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,880
We've been avoiding the novel so far

351
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,120
since we'll get back to it later,

352
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,760
but the plot of Ship of Theseus

353
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,060
makes far more sense

354
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,380
when viewed as a reflection of Václav's life

355
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,860
being in the S-organisation.

356
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,040
For context,

357
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,560
the first four chapters

358
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,360
consist of

359
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,740
an unnamed protagonist

360
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,280
being reborn from a river,

361
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,940
meeting a group of sheer names

362
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,720
with the birds in this hotel register,

363
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,400
and witnessing a massacre

364
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
of striking workers

365
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,380
organised by an evil factory owner.

366
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,140
Seems pretty cut and dry.

367
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,860
Václav would also have been

368
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,200
the best option for Caldeira,

369
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,940
which she herself admits to Eric.

370
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,080
He was the youngest of the main candidates,

371
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,680
though still older than Caldeira,

372
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,640
and the most free to run away with her

373
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,320
if he chose.

374
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,620
So, from this point onwards,

375
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,720
Jen and Eric form a new theory.

376
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,360
The news article said that

377
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,180
Václav was holding his manuscript

378
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:46,980
when he jumped.

379
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,360
One of the few things we know about Ekstrom

380
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,700
is that he was a great swimmer at university.

381
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
What if Ekstrom is the one

382
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,440
who dove after Václav

383
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,240
and succeeded in saving him?

384
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,500
Then he and Durand bring him to the hotel

385
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,580
after noticing his soggy manuscript pages.

386
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,920
In fact, what if those pages

387
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,420
became the first novel,

388
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,340
The Miracle at Braxenholm?

389
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,420
Consider this possible timeline.

390
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Durand and Ekstrom

391
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,960
save a young radical

392
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,200
who has a broken heart

393
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,240
and a book he needs help reconstructing.

394
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,280
They decide to take him under their wing

395
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,100
and invite their like-minded friends

396
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,120
to meet him too,

397
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,360
so Václav suddenly has a community.

398
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,720
Then, after Braxenholm is published

399
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,920
and becomes a sensation,

400
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,600
the group realises that

401
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,420
maybe they can use Václav's anonymity

402
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,500
to make political statements

403
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,740
they otherwise couldn't

404
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,420
as VMS.

405
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,640
If any of these people

406
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,120
were at the Calais Massacre

407
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,000
and Chapter 3 of Ship Athysius

408
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,700
suggests Václav himself

409
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,260
could have been,

410
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,720
then trying to expose Bouchard

411
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,580
would be a great place to start.

412
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,980
As to why Václav went along

413
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,660
with all this,

414
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,400
who knows?

415
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,020
Maybe he felt indebted

416
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,280
to Ekstrom and Durand.

417
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,660
Maybe he was excited

418
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,700
to be a proper writer.

419
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,780
FXC thought Václav

420
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,120
was in love with Durand,

421
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,460
but an entry in Ekstrom's diary

422
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,140
from May 1929

423
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,900
suggests that the relationship

424
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,220
was more paternal.

425
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,080
Our friend has become

426
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,340
more like a son to me

427
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,680
than I ever thought possible.

428
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,420
A feels similarly.

429
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,440
Grateful.

430
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,080
For what it's worth,

431
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,960
Eric does think that all the books

432
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,440
share a consistent vision,

433
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,620
one person's rage at the world

434
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,980
and love of the written word.

435
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,200
So if he's right,

436
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,040
that person could be Václav,

437
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,820
having a hand in all the novels

438
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,040
as the organisation's hidden face.

439
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,620
The theory Jen and Eric

440
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,680
seem to settle on

441
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,560
is that the others

442
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,000
co-wrote all the books

443
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,280
except the last three.

444
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,720
The love story of Winged Shoes,

445
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,600
the messy search for identity

446
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,460
in Coriolis,

447
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,680
and the guilty and mournful

448
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,580
protagonist of Ship of Theseus,

449
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,360
who watches his friends die

450
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,320
one by one.

451
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,020
Here's the rub, though.

452
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,800
This is all really speculation.

453
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,140
Jen and Eric don't have much proof.

454
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,020
They know that these S members,

455
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,960
let's call them the original S,

456
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,200
all met before Braxton Home was published.

457
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,880
But we need more evidence

458
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,860
of what happened next.

459
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,240
Well, in the yellow-green phase,

460
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,540
Jen emails a museum

461
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,980
dedicated to Durand

462
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,920
and surprisingly,

463
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,560
gets a bunch of documents back.

464
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,980
These include excerpts

465
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,980
from Durand's diaries,

466
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,380
which give other examples

467
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,820
of S members meeting up.

468
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,160
On 31st of October 1921,

469
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Ekstrom, Durand,

470
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,880
and Guthrie McInnes

471
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,100
all have dinner together

472
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,840
in Alexandria

473
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,040
while Durand is on a dig,

474
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,300
which we can guess

475
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,880
is when he was first invited in.

476
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,380
McInnes and Summers Bay

477
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,240
are probably the two

478
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
most important figures

479
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,200
in the S-Org's

480
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
second generation,

481
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,760
so to speak.

482
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,620
But Eric also casually names

483
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,660
quite a number of other

484
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,440
possible members

485
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,720
on page 268.

486
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,160
Sing is the only relevant one,

487
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,020
as he's confirmed

488
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,480
in another Durand diary entry

489
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,120
from January 1st, 1922.

490
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,280
She mentions meeting

491
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,640
with all the old pseudonyms

492
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
plus new ones.

493
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,520
Saras,

494
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,520
Hindi for Stork,

495
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,180
so Sing,

496
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,240
Pierich,

497
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,740
Scottish Gaelic for Parrot,

498
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,120
possibly Guthrie McInnes,

499
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,000
Finch,

500
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:56,840
Summers Bay,

501
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,780
and Swan,

502
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:58,700
unknown,

503
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,900
possibly Lewis Looper.

504
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,540
Sing is also likely

505
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,100
the co-author

506
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,760
for 100 Aprils of Amritsar

507
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,880
and helped influence

508
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,660
Washington and Green,

509
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,660
as Eric claims

510
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,560
his style and themes

511
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,140
are similar,

512
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,220
so we can add him

513
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,120
to our authors list.

514
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,620
Although this all

515
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,260
seems to be going swimmingly,

516
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,900
the S must have fallen apart

517
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,680
at some point.

518
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,820
From early on,

519
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,620
we get mentions

520
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,840
of a new S

521
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,640
and hints that

522
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,520
one or more members

523
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,100
sold out the original group.

524
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,720
If you've been paying attention,

525
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,480
you might assume

526
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,200
this is a reference

527
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,320
to the Ferrara-Durand betrayal,

528
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,460
but Jen and Eric

529
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,200
specifically mention McInnes.

530
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,480
So what happened?

531
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,880
Here's where

532
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,160
Caldera's ciphers

533
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,240
finally come in.

534
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,940
Through these,

535
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,320
we learn of three betrayals

536
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,580
that VMS himself

537
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,940
seemingly didn't know about,

538
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,980
which helped cause

539
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,740
the downfall

540
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,100
of the S organization.

541
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,240
First off,

542
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,940
the Chapter 2

543
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,720
footnote cipher

544
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,620
gives the phrase

545
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,720
Looper Agent.

546
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,740
This one is complicated.

547
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,500
Jen and Eric

548
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,600
say Looper split

549
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,300
from the S in 1926,

550
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,280
which means

551
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,800
he must have been

552
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,500
a real guy

553
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,700
and not just VMS.

554
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,800
But to complicate matters further,

555
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Eric says this

556
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,320
on page 308.

557
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,500
Maybe Looper

558
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,780
and the Amanuensis

559
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,560
had scrubbed

560
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,820
slash secret histories.

561
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,740
The second,

562
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,620
far more pressing

563
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,520
cipher revelation

564
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,740
is in Chapter 6

565
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,780
when FXC

566
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,500
tries to tell

567
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,060
Stracca

568
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,740
that

569
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,720
Mac was Judas,

570
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,580
not Tiago.

571
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,060
In other words,

572
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,520
McInnes is the one

573
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,580
who betrayed Durand.

574
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,920
Ferrara disappeared

575
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,480
a few days

576
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,220
before her death,

577
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,040
so everyone assumed

578
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,560
it was him.

579
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,280
But nope,

580
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,160
the poor guy

581
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,900
was set up.

582
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,280
This has ramifications

583
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,660
not just on the past,

584
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,800
but the present too,

585
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,000
as Jen finds out

586
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,320
for the last 10 years,

587
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,420
Professor Moody

588
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,340
has been receiving

589
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,120
funding from

590
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,300
the McInnes Foundation

591
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,920
via the aptly named

592
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,360
Caledonian Society

593
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,200
for Literature.

594
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,920
When Eric visits Caldera,

595
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,820
she tells him more

596
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,860
about her interactions

597
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,660
with McInnes.

598
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,600
Apparently,

599
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
he fancied himself

600
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,040
as a Casanova type

601
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,900
who could swoon

602
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,460
any woman

603
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,440
with a bottle of wine,

604
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,840
a trick he tried

605
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,020
on both FXC

606
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,680
and Durand

607
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,900
to poor results.

608
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,480
It doesn't seem unlikely,

609
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,580
given everything else

610
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,040
about him,

611
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,240
that McInnes might have

612
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,660
resented their rejections,

613
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,720
and that's partly why

614
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,540
he didn't hesitate

615
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,820
to target them both.

616
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,640
In early 1946,

617
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,180
though,

618
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,740
McInnes visited Caldera

619
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,160
once again in New York,

620
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,060
claiming that he

621
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,920
desperately needed

622
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,720
to get in touch

623
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,840
with the real Straca

624
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,180
and tried to bribe her.

625
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,540
Although obviously

626
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,660
she said she didn't know,

627
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,740
she always wondered

628
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,920
afterwards if she could

629
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,620
have accidentally

630
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,440
given him something

631
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,320
he could use.

632
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,140
Now,

633
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,960
you might be wondering,

634
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,320
why did McInnes not know

635
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,940
how to contact Straca himself?

636
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,360
Jen and Eric wonder

637
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,040
the same thing

638
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,260
on page 293.

639
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,580
Eric theorises

640
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,980
that perhaps the only people

641
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,580
who knew his true identity

642
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,240
were the original members.

643
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,080
However,

644
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,340
Jen mentions that

645
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,200
Somersby did seem

646
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,040
to have met him too

647
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,980
based on his letters.

648
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,140
Either way,

649
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,040
clearly everyone

650
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,720
who did know

651
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,620
kept it a secret

652
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,000
even among the S.

653
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,260
It's worth mentioning,

654
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:45,780
by the way,

655
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,920
during Eric's meeting

656
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,720
with FXC,

657
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,720
he shows her

658
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,680
the Somersby tape

659
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,840
and she becomes emotional.

660
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,180
She thinks Somersby

661
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,280
probably confessed,

662
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,500
so McInnes' S

663
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,400
would leave her alone.

664
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,880
The last big cipher

665
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,980
revelation involves

666
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,960
another sidelined

667
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,860
member of the S,

668
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,440
Horst Wexler.

669
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,380
The chapter 3 cipher

670
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,280
translates to

671
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,760
ARP is Bouchard

672
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,880
is HW.

673
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,260
This is how Jen

674
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,100
connects the ARP

675
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,960
syndicate company

676
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,720
to Bouchard,

677
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,240
but what about HW?

678
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,560
Eric says that

679
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,040
if it meant

680
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,200
Horst Wexler,

681
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,240
then VMS

682
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,320
was in real danger.

683
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,500
But sure enough,

684
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,460
the pieces add up.

685
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,740
Jen finds a record

686
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,460
of Wexler

687
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,220
as a passenger

688
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:23,820
on a ship

689
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,520
leaving Dublin

690
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,200
for Liverpool

691
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,220
one week

692
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,140
before Feuerbach

693
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,700
was killed.

694
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:28,960
The ship vanished

695
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,040
somewhere over the water,

696
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,540
but Eric later says

697
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,960
HW lived.

698
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,200
It turns out

699
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,420
an H. Wexler

700
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,460
entered Rotterdam

701
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,620
in June 1940

702
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,240
and subsequently vanished.

703
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,540
But then in a photo

704
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,180
of the ARP

705
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,020
syndicate board

706
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,700
of directors,

707
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,660
there is a man

708
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,920
called Gernot Klein

709
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,200
who looks exactly

710
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,000
like Wexler.

711
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,200
Did Wexler

712
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,880
leave Dublin

713
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,680
because he knew

714
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,560
Feuerbach was going

715
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,140
to be targeted?

716
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,320
Why would he

717
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,000
sell him out

718
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,820
after decades?

719
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,060
The answer seems

720
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,180
to be for money

721
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,040
and success.

722
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,260
Wexler was

723
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,180
the only original

724
00:25:59,180 --> 00:25:59,800
S member

725
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,820
who wasn't a writer.

726
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,620
He apparently

727
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,020
wrote some dispatches

728
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,000
for small Spanish

729
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,140
anarchist publications

730
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,640
and was writing

731
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,200
a novel,

732
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,660
but it never got published.

733
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,420
However,

734
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,780
FXC says that

735
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,640
in 1940

736
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,400
she received

737
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,980
a manuscript

738
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,020
sent from Dublin

739
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,180
that was far worse

740
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,880
quality than

741
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,960
VMS's usual

742
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,540
manuscripts.

743
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,840
It was in English

744
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,040
but with spelling mistakes

745
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,840
that seemed like

746
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,000
a native German speaker

747
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,500
wrote it,

748
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,740
and VMS later

749
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,640
asked for it back

750
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,860
so he could destroy it.

751
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,960
Perhaps this was Wexler

752
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,820
and the rejection

753
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,780
left him open

754
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,700
to being tempted

755
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,580
by Bouchard.

756
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,560
At ARP

757
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,200
he had power

758
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,960
and influence

759
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,620
and respect

760
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,560
which he may not

761
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,000
have gotten

762
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,560
from the other

763
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,140
S members.

764
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,200
So just to recap,

765
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,120
over the course

766
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,040
of 15 years

767
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,020
all the original

768
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,840
members of the S

769
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,280
were either

770
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
bought by Bouchard

771
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,820
or killed

772
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,760
with the exception

773
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,380
of Vaclav.

774
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,720
The timeline we have

775
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,200
is thus.

776
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,520
Looper disappears

777
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
in 1926,

778
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,700
Ekstrom dies

779
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,600
in 1931,

780
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,920
Durand dies

781
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,560
and Ferraro's

782
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,040
outcast in 1937,

783
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,260
Horst Wexler

784
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:57,780
disappears

785
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,480
and Feuerbach

786
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,600
dies in 1940,

787
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,820
Vaclav dies in 1946,

788
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,920
Summersby dies

789
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,880
in 1951.

790
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,360
Sources conflict

791
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,040
about McInnis.

792
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,080
Desjardins' notes

793
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,800
suggest he left

794
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,820
S in 1964

795
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,100
but Summersby said

796
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,800
it was much earlier,

797
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,900
pre-1951

798
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,040
but he must have

799
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,400
been turned

800
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,600
before 1937

801
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,520
and could have been

802
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,540
as early as 1930.

803
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,260
Jen also mentions

804
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,020
Singh was alive

805
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,140
by the 1940s.

806
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,560
This decline

807
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,700
is sad to see

808
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,660
and seems to have

809
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,800
affected Vaclav as well.

810
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,020
FXC reports

811
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,560
he felt like

812
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,600
the last of his kind.

813
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,320
So that basically

814
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,560
brings us to present day

815
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,640
but still doesn't

816
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,360
explain it.

817
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,560
As Jarek says

818
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,700
on page 396,

819
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,740
people are still

820
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,300
going missing,

821
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,020
falling,

822
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,400
getting Santorini-manned

823
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,360
so someone's

824
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,040
out there fighting.

825
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,580
Hope the S is

826
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,060
because the new S is.

827
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,880
Eric also says,

828
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,780
a lot of things

829
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,360
that look like

830
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,880
they're S

831
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,800
or new S related

832
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,320
are happening

833
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,980
all of a sudden.

834
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,120
What if all of that

835
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,660
isn't over?

836
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,960
What if it went dormant

837
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,240
but now it's coming back?

838
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Let's discuss

839
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,620
one of these

840
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,520
present day victims

841
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,040
for a moment,

842
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,780
our old friend Desjardins.

843
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,480
He seems awfully

844
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,220
well informed,

845
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:01,740
doesn't he?

846
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,940
He certainly theorised

847
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,480
more accurately

848
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,740
than every other researcher.

849
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:05,880
Turns out

850
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,320
Jean B had a big secret.

851
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,880
During the secret dinner

852
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,980
Eric attended in Paris,

853
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,600
someone referred to Desjardins

854
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,200
as a widower

855
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,080
and other students

856
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,740
responded by

857
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,000
immediately shutting them down.

858
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,520
In the purple-red phase,

859
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,220
Eric discovers

860
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,980
that Desjardins

861
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,260
indeed married a woman

862
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,500
called Signé Rab

863
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,340
in Carcassonne

864
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,620
in 1952.

865
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,540
This is wild

866
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,560
because that name

867
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,820
is in Ship of Theseus,

868
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,100
added by FXC

869
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,780
to the interlude

870
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,960
as a direct question

871
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,600
to Straga.

872
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,160
Who is Signé Rab?

873
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,700
On the wedding invitation,

874
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,580
we see that

875
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,440
Signé's date of birth

876
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,160
is listed as

877
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,440
4th of November 1930

878
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,580
and her mother

879
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,740
as A. Rab.

880
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,080
Rab is apparently

881
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,260
German for raven,

882
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,400
matching the pseudonym

883
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,120
Corbeau.

884
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:44,900
So,

885
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,920
logic detates

886
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,580
A. Rab

887
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,940
is Amarante Durand

888
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,800
and Signé

889
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,920
is Durand's daughter.

890
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,460
We have two sources

891
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,400
which corroborate this.

892
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,820
In October 1930,

893
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,940
Somersby wrote

894
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,860
a letter to Ekstrom

895
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,800
saying he was

896
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,820
distressed to hear

897
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,660
of A's lengthy

898
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,600
hospital exile,

899
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,700
perhaps a rough

900
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,820
pregnancy for Durand.

901
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,040
Then in November,

902
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:03,980
Ekstrom writes

903
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,600
in his diary

904
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,660
that his friend

905
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,300
visits him

906
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,360
and he finds it hard

907
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,400
not to weep openly,

908
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,700
weeping with joy

909
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,540
to see his daughter

910
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,400
and surrogate son

911
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,180
together perhaps?

912
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,060
Now,

913
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,340
apparently some S-fans

914
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,120
believe Durand

915
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,680
and Vaclav

916
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,740
were involved romantically

917
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,000
and Signé is his daughter,

918
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,580
which we do not.

919
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,180
But FXC clearly

920
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,220
shares their concern.

921
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,240
Eric brought up

922
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,320
her question when they met

923
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,060
before he knew

924
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,220
about Desjardins' marriage

925
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,140
and she says

926
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,000
she only knew the name

927
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,740
because McInnis

928
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,280
mentioned it

929
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,920
in their meeting.

930
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:30,920
Personally,

931
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,800
I'd still argue

932
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,640
it's insane

933
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,700
for Caldeira to write

934
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,760
Who is Signé Rab

935
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,580
directly into

936
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,220
Ship of Theseus

937
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,320
when Bouchard agents

938
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
are actively tracking

939
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,020
down anyone

940
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,100
connected with the S.

941
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,540
But she apparently

942
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,580
assumed it was Durand

943
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,440
and never found out

944
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:43,860
otherwise.

945
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,380
Ironically though,

946
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,200
FXC did meet Desjardins.

947
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,100
In fact,

948
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
he was who gave her

949
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,200
the final pages

950
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,100
of Ship of Theseus.

951
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,820
Alongside that package

952
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,560
sent to Jarek,

953
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,480
she recounts

954
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,280
how a French man

955
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,800
moving with great sadness

956
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,940
delivered them to her

957
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,940
in the mid-70s.

958
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,040
Turns out,

959
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,660
Signé died in 1956

960
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,000
after a long illness,

961
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,020
which we don't learn

962
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,960
until page 434.

963
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,500
This tragedy

964
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,140
adds to Desjardins' motivations

965
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,000
and could explain

966
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,780
why he fell out

967
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,200
with Moody

968
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,180
because the latter

969
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,180
started getting funding

970
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,940
from McInnis,

971
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,460
the guy who orphaned Signé.

972
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,620
Like McInnis,

973
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,920
Moody places money

974
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,360
and fame

975
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,260
before honesty

976
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:18,840
and loyalty.

977
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:19,660
Hence,

978
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,500
Desjardins knew

979
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,500
he could trust Eric

980
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,060
as someone

981
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,980
who wasn't in league

982
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,360
with Moody

983
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,100
and didn't have

984
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,760
any connection

985
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,380
to his money.

986
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,020
Back to Signé though,

987
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,420
where did this poor kid

988
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,820
go in the 1930s

989
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,980
after both her parents

990
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,360
died?

991
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,040
We do get an answer.

992
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,940
That lawyer's daughter

993
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,200
tells Eric a story

994
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,380
about a little girl

995
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,240
with no parents

996
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,960
who was chased

997
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,700
around the world

998
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,620
by bad people

999
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,720
and had two uncles

1000
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,540
who took turns

1001
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,420
being her dad.

1002
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,980
Given the context,

1003
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,060
one of these uncles

1004
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,760
must have been

1005
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,340
Summersby

1006
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,680
and although we're

1007
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,400
speculating,

1008
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,560
we think the other

1009
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,220
is Vaclav.

1010
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,640
Everyone is dead

1011
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,280
at this point

1012
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,100
apart from him

1013
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,180
and newer members

1014
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,760
like Sing

1015
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,840
but no one else

1016
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,480
was as close

1017
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,780
to Ekstrom and Durand

1018
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,600
or as able

1019
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,900
to keep Signé a secret.

1020
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,080
This would help

1021
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,780
explain a few

1022
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,820
outstanding questions.

1023
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,720
Firstly,

1024
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,140
when recording his tape,

1025
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,260
Summersby wasn't

1026
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,320
just trying to protect

1027
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,580
his friend FXC,

1028
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,700
he was also

1029
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,720
protecting Signé.

1030
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,720
He was obviously

1031
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,780
trapped with agents

1032
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,320
on board

1033
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,400
and maybe he thought

1034
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,320
it would convince them

1035
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,560
that the S was over.

1036
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,180
Summersby is absolutely

1037
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,100
the best S member

1038
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,820
for the record.

1039
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:22,980
Additionally,

1040
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,520
Vaclav being Signé's

1041
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,580
guardian gives him

1042
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,840
more reason to postpone

1043
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,880
meeting with Caldeira.

1044
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,780
He could have been

1045
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,760
worried about risking

1046
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,360
Signé for selfish gain.

1047
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,400
After all,

1048
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,320
Summersby was friends

1049
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,940
with her too

1050
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,060
but never told

1051
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,680
so perhaps he and Vaclav

1052
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,620
swore secrecy.

1053
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,780
On the downside,

1054
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,820
this would mean that

1055
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,360
Signé lost all four

1056
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,300
parental figures

1057
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,260
before dying young herself.

1058
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,920
A very sad life

1059
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,300
but clearly treasured

1060
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,080
by Desjardins.

1061
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,980
We're coming to the end

1062
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,760
of this section now,

1063
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,200
having covered all the details

1064
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,640
we can gain from the footnotes

1065
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,820
and notes in S.

1066
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:55,700
However,

1067
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,160
as you've probably noticed,

1068
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,560
there are a number of details

1069
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,120
we haven't made sense of yet,

1070
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,880
listed here.

1071
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,220
Some of these

1072
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,340
we will get insight into

1073
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:03,960
from the novel

1074
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,360
and others we won't

1075
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,600
but we will do our best

1076
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
to address each of them.

1077
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,860
For now though,

1078
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,220
let's tackle one of the very

1079
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,260
first mysteries raised.

1080
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,320
Did Stracca really die in Havana?

1081
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,680
It's not a very exciting answer

1082
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,020
but there's essentially

1083
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,580
no evidence that he didn't.

1084
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,260
His assumed defenestration

1085
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,400
lines up with all other

1086
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,320
S-related deaths

1087
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,240
and one would think

1088
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,100
if he did survive

1089
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,620
then there would be some trace

1090
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,020
but he doesn't reach out

1091
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,780
to FXC,

1092
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,060
Signé or Summersby

1093
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,060
as the chapter 7 footnotes show

1094
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,260
Some losing hope,

1095
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,340
please get in touch.

1096
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,640
But FXC didn't give up hope

1097
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,500
for a long time

1098
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,980
as we see through her ciphers.

1099
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,400
The chapter 1 code

1100
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,640
solved on page 27

1101
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
spells out

1102
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,460
Argosé every 19th

1103
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,560
1900 hours

1104
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,820
Meeting instructions

1105
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,420
for Vaclav

1106
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,220
and then the chapter 5 cipher

1107
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,940
gives the message

1108
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,680
We'll wait 10 years then home

1109
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,920
which is what she does.

1110
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,680
A couple of additional footnotes

1111
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,980
remind him where home is

1112
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,240
essentially inviting him

1113
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,280
to come seek safety

1114
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:57,880
in L'Ansois

1115
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,820
Yet without him doing so

1116
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,720
we are left to wonder

1117
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,440
whether Vaclav

1118
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,200
ever returned Caldera's love.

1119
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,360
Eric and Jen

1120
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,660
both think she may have been

1121
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,340
too committed

1122
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,280
considering the lack

1123
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,360
of evident reciprocation

1124
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,960
he was her whole life

1125
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,700
for decades.

1126
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,620
Vaclav seems like

1127
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,720
a complicated man

1128
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,040
and the only insight

1129
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,020
we have into his

1130
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,360
true feelings and thoughts

1131
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,780
is Shepethesius.

1132
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,920
So it's finally time

1133
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,060
to see what we can learn

1134
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,940
from the novel

1135
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,440
get some sense of closure

1136
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,380
and understand

1137
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,700
what it was truly like

1138
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,660
to be VMS.
